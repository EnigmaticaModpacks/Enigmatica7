  Hey there! :wave: This repository uses the [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
  code style.

  You forgot to format these files in your pull request:

  {{#files}}

  - {{.}}

  {{/files}}

  The [Prettier installation guide](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) is
  a good place to get started with formatting your code properly. Thanks!

  :heart:

  Your friendly [Prettifier bot](https://www.prettifier.io).  

# Template for commit messages from Prettifier.
# Placeholders are:
# - {{commitSha}}: the SHA of your commit that Prettifier formats
commitMessage: "Format {{commitSha}}"

# Files that Prettifier should ignore.
# Please try ignoring them using Prettier first: https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html.
# Values are globs similar to how .gitignore works: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore.
# Default: empty
excludeFiles:
  - minecraftinstance.json
